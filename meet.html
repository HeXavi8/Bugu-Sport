				<h2>Expectations</h2>
				<p><li> We hope to cooperate with more schools' sports departments or associations to create a better
					campus sports community and provide users with better services.
				<li> We also hope to introduce professional resources, such as coaches and referees, to provide
					professional guidance for students. We hope to build up a scouting system to explore more
					potential players.
				</p>
				</br>
					<h2>Meet the Developer</h2>
					<p><li> Our team is composed of 3 programmers and one user interface designer. We are also sports
					lovers, focusing on the development of campus sports. We hope to contribute to the development
					of campus sports so that the campus sports atmosphere can be more robust. We also hope that
					students can have more ways to compete with partners from different campuses and schools.
				<li> Developing this mini-program, on the one hand, is to explore the possibilities of campus sports
					and find more inspiration in practice to be more likely to help the development of campus
					sports in the future on the other hand.
				<li> Due to our initial experience, our team size is relatively small, and Bugu-Sports still has
					various deficiencies and constant iteration.
				<li> After some exploration of on-campus sports, we found many problems and resistance. However, our
					desire to help the development of campus sports remains. Therefore, we sincerely hope that more
					and more people will pay attention to campus sports and even devote themselves to them.
					Together, we can create a different possibility for the development of campus sports.
